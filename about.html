<h1>Some of my notable courses</h1>

<p>Two of my most notable courses I took were interpersonal communications and intro to programming java. the most notable project I had in my java course was coding a carpet calculator. I found this assigment to be a little difficult but none the less very interesting. One of the more notable assigments ive had in interpersonal communications was discussing a short film called Dinner For Two. The short film was about two chameleons fighting over the same bug.Their constant fight caused many issues for not only themselves, But for the other animals in the forest aswell.</p>
